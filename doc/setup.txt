obliquid-lib SETUP

obliquid-lib is built with Maven. If you have a working installation of Maven it will
download all dependendents libraries automatically.

Unit tests are grouped in two suites: org.obliquid.junit.SuiteForAllTest contains all
tests that don't require a DB, org.obliquid.junit.SuiteForDbTest contains all tests
that do require DBs.

To create the DBs run the following commands with MySQL root user:

mysql -u root -pRootPassword --default-character-set=utf8 < user.sql
mysql -u root -pRootPassword --default-character-set=utf8 < schema.sql
mysql -u root -pRootPassword --default-character-set=utf8 < data.sql

Host configuration should be created as a class in org.obliquid.config with the same 
name as the computer name with the first letter uppercase.
