org.obliquid.helpers are Java helper classes released with LGPL3 licence.

== Maven Quick Start ==

This project uses Maven, if you know it already you can stop reading now. Otherwise read the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html Maven Getting Started Guide].  Supposing that Maven is already installed on your system, here are some useful commands:

'''mvn compile''' downloads dependencies and compiles the project, classes are generated in
target/classes directory.

'''mvn test''' runs the test suite, thus running all tests

'''mvn clean''' deletes the target/ directory with all generated artifacts

'''mvn package''' generates a jar file in the target/ directory

'''mvn eclipse:eclipse''' generates or updates eclipse project files, run this command every time a new dependency is added to pom.xml - I've blogged in more details about [http://www.stefanolocati.it/blog/?p=917 external dependencies]

'''mvn javadoc:javadoc''' generates the Javadoc files in target/site/apidocs/
