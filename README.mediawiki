= org.obliquid.helpers = 

org.obliquid.helpers are static Java helper classes released with LGPL3 licence.
Maven is used to pull dependencies and build the project. All classes are not
meant to be comprehensive, but they contain what I need, YAGNI style.

The following classes are committed to date:

;DateHelper
: Helper Class for Dates, both Java Dates and Joda Dates.
;SimpleStopWatch 
: Simple Stop Watch with seconds and milliseconds timings and sleep functions wrapped to ignore exceptions.

== Maven Quick Start ==

This project uses Maven, if you know it already you can stop reading now. Otherwise read the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html Maven Getting Started Guide].

In short, supposing that Maven is already installed on your system, here are some useful commands:

''mvn compile'' downloads dependencies and compiles the project, classes are generated in
target/classes directory.

''mvn test'' runs the test suite, thus running all tests

''mvn clean'' deletes the target/ directory with all generated artifacts

''mvn eclipse:eclipse'' generates or updates eclipse project files, run this command every time a new dependency is added to pom.xml - I've blogged in more details about [http://www.stefanolocati.it/blog/?p=917 external dependencies]

''mvn package'' generates a jar file in the target/ directory
